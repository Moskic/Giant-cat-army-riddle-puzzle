# Giant cat army riddle puzzle
Simple interactive interface for TED-Ed video: Can you solve the giant cat army riddle? - Dan Finkel (https://youtu.be/YeMVoJKn1Tg?si=sovx2abRssrN6tNm)

Rules:
1. There are 3 buttons that change the display: "+5","+7", and "âˆš"
2. The display starts at 0.
3. To solve the puzzle, the display must output the numbers 2, 10, and 14, in that order.
4. The display can safely output other numbers, unless:
     - it outputs the same number twice
     - it outputs a number greater than 60
     - it outputs a non-whole number
7. If the above requirements are not met, the game ends.
